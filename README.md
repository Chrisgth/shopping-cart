A shopping cart application built using React.

- The app utilizes a simple JSON database hosted on GitHub pages to fetch and display data.

- The data is displayed in a simple paginated format of 4 items per page.

- Users can interact with items by clicking on them after which the data for that specific item will be displayed in a more detailed view.

- Users can then add a specific amount of the selected item into their cart.

- The app will then store all relevant cart information inside of browser local storage.

- Users can view their cart page where all of their selected items will be displayed and a grand total is shown.
